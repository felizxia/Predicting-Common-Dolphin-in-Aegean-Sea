Predicting Common Dolphin Delphinus delphis distribution in Aegean Sea area by machine learning models

With sighting data and tracking data in 2016 and 2017, we want to explore how Chlorophyll, Salinity, Sea Surface Height, Sea Surface Temperature, Distance from shore and Slope will influence common dolphin Delphinus delphis’ appearance in Aegean Sea area. On the base of key factor analysis, we want to use machine learning models to predict the common dolphins appearance based on known environmental factors’ values. We also provided with alternatives for future researchers in order to reach higher accuracy of predicting common dolphins’ active area.
